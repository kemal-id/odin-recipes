        <h4>Steps 1</h4>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot salted water to a boil and cook pasta until tender with a bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Reserve 1
          cup pasta water, then drain pasta.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Steps 2</h4>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and then sausage. Cook sausage, breaking it up with a
          spatula until it starts to brown, about 7 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Steps 3</h4>
        <p>
          Add garlic and a little more olive oil if skillet seems dry. Pour in wine, and use a spoon to scrape up any
          browned bits on the bottom of the skillet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Steps 4</h4>
        <p>
          Simmer until wine has reduced by about half; add pasta water and half the Parmesan. Stir, then add cream. Stir
          again, season with salt and pepper. Let it cook for a minute, then stir in pasta. Check for seasoning, then
          add in remaining Parmesan. Stir well and serve sprinkled with parsley.
