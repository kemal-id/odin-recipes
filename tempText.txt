Bring a large pot salted water to a boil and cook pasta until tender with a bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain pasta.

Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and then sausage. Cook sausage, breaking it up with a spatula until it starts to brown, about 7 minutes.

Add garlic and a little more olive oil if skillet seems dry. Pour in wine, and use a spoon to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet.

Simmer until wine has reduced by about half; add pasta water and half the Parmesan. Stir, then add cream. Stir again, season with salt and pepper. Let it cook for a minute, then stir in pasta. Check for seasoning, then add in remaining Parmesan. Stir well and serve sprinkled with parsley.
